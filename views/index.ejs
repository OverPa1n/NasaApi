                APOD API - One of the most popular websites at NASA is the <a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html"> Astronomy Picture of the Day</a>.
                In fact, this website is one of <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/">the most popular websites</a> across all federal agencies. It has the popular appeal of a Justin Bieber video. This endpoint structures the APOD imagery and associated metadata so that it can be repurposed for other applications. In addition, if the concept_tags parameter is set to True, then keywords derived from the image explanation are returned. These keywords could be used as auto-generated hashtags for twitter or instagram feeds; but generally help with discoverability of relevant imagery.

                The full documentation for this API can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/nasa/apod-api">APOD API Github repository</a>.</p>

                This API is designed to collect image data gathered by NASA's Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit rovers on
                Mars and make it more easily available to other developers, educators, and citizen scientists.
                This API is maintained by <a href="https://github.com/chrisccerami/mars-photo-api">Chris Cerami.</a>
                Each rover has its own set of photos stored in the database,
                which can be queried separately. There are several possible queries that can be made against the API.
                Photos are organized by the sol (Martian rotation or day) on which they were taken,
                counting up from the rover's landing date. A photo taken on Curiosity's 1000th Martian sol exploring Mars,
                for example, will have a sol attribute of 1000.
                If instead you prefer to search by the Earth date on which a photo was taken, you can do that too.
